# **Bed Leveling Guide for the Ender 3 V3 SE**

Struggling with bed leveling on your Ender 3 V3 SE? This guide walks you through the process of fine-tuning your Z offset, using the auto-leveling feature for a smooth bed surface, and troubleshooting any uneven spots with manual leveling. For additional support, we’ve included links to helpful videos and community forums. Follow these steps to achieve a perfectly leveled bed for high-quality prints every time!


### Step 1: Adjust the Z Offset
   - If your bed appears unlevel, start by adjusting the Z offset. This setting controls the height of the nozzle relative to the bed surface and is a simple adjustment that can often resolve minor leveling issues.

### Step 2: Use the Auto-Leveling Feature
   - If adjusting the Z offset doesn’t solve the problem, try using the printer’s auto-leveling calibration function. Once the auto-leveling is complete, the bed matrix displayed on the interface should ideally appear all green (or a uniform color), indicating even bed calibration.
   - After this, adjust the Z offset once more to fine-tune the leveling and get the nozzle at the perfect height for printing. This should generally ensure a level bed.

### Step 3: Check the Matrix for Variations
   - If the matrix shows colors other than green (such as blue, red, or yellow), this indicates that certain sections of the bed are still uneven. In this case, you may need to manually level the bed.
