### Project Background
The idea for this project started as a college initiative to set up a fully-functional, upgraded Ender 3 V3 SE for student learning and experimentation. Developed under the guidance of Dr. O.P. Mishra, with funding of â‚¹20,000, the project included purchasing the printer kit, assembling it, upgrading various components, and configuring remote access using OctoPlus for Wi-Fi-controlled printing. The goal was to equip our peers with a well-rounded, open-source 3D printing solution that could serve multiple purposes.

### Project Aim and Benefits
The project aimed to provide a versatile and accessible 3D printer setup for hands-on learning. Key benefits of the project include:

1. **Open Source Design**: Allows modifications and improvements.
2. **Cost-Effective**: More affordable than commercial alternatives.
3. **Easy Availability of Spare Parts**: Readily available and affordable components.
4. **Auto Bed Leveling**: Ensures consistent print quality.
5. **Wi-Fi Controlled**: Convenient operation with remote access.
6. **Resume Function**: Automatically resumes printing after power interruptions.
7. **Auto Filament Loading and Unloading**: Streamlines filament changes.
8. **Stable Dual Z-Axis**: Enhances stability and precision.
9. **Direct Extrusion**: Improves print quality, especially for flexible filaments.
